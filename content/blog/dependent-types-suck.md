STOP DOING DEPENDENT TYPES
- Types were not supposed to be given computation!
- YEARS of typechecking but NO real world use for going higher than GADTS
- Wanted to go higher anyway for a laugh? We had a tool for that: It was called RUNTIME VERIFICATION
- "Yes please give me `Id A x x` of something. Please give me `Vec (m + n) A` of it." -- Statements dreamed up by the UTTERLY INSANE 

Look at what computer scientists have been doing, with all the languages and typecheckers we built for them: 
(This is REAL dependent types, done by REAL computer scientists)

sq2 : ◀.F-map-iso (◀.F-map-iso (ρ≅ Iso⁻¹)) ∙Iso α≅
    ≡ (α≅ ∙Iso α≅) ∙Iso ▶.F-map-iso (λ≅ Iso⁻¹)
sq2 = ≅-path $
    α→ _ _ _ ∘ ((ρ← ⊗₁ id) ⊗₁ id)    ≡
    (ρ← ⊗₁ ⌜ id ⊗₁ id ⌝) ∘ α→ _ _ _  ≡
    (ρ← ⊗₁ id) ∘ α→ _ _ _            ≡˘
    (id ⊗₁ λ←) ∘ α→ _ _ _ ∘ α→ _ _ _ ∎

```coq
Lemma next_spoke_ring (y : G) : y \in r -> next r y = face (spoke y).
Proof.
move=> ry; have [cycFp Up] := andP ucycFp.
rewrite -{1}[y]nodeK (next_map inj_spoke) ?rev_uniq // (next_rev Up).
rewrite -[prev p _]faceK /spoke ee -(canRL nodeK (nnn y)).
by rewrite (eqP (prev_cycle cycFp _)) // -Ep -Er.
Qed.
